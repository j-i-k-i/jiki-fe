# TODO List

Commit and push after each fix. Run all tests (including unit, integration, e2e, tsc and lint) before committing. If you're on `main` create a feature branch and a PR. If you're already on a feature branch, confirm with the human if you should push to this feature branch or create a new feature branch.

- [x] Run e2e tests on port 3070
- [ ] Move the app/test-extensions and app/dev/code-mirror testing, so they're both in app/test instead.
