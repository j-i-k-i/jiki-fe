# Sound Files Directory

This directory contains sound files for the quiz application.

## Required Files

- `success.mp3` - Played when answer is correct
- `error.mp3` - Played when answer is incorrect
- `click.mp3` - Played on button clicks
- `warning.mp3` - Played for warnings
- `complete.mp3` - Played when quiz is complete

## Placeholder Files

The `.mp3.placeholder` files are temporary placeholders to prevent 404 errors during development.
Replace them with actual .mp3 files from:

- https://freesound.org/
- https://www.zapsplat.com/
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/

## Note

The sound system will gracefully handle missing files with console warnings, so the app will work even without actual sound files.
