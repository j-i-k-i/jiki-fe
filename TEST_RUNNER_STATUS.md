# Test Runner Implementation Status

## âœ… Completed

### Core Implementation
- **Exercise System**: Base Exercise class with animations and state management
- **BasicExercise**: Simple exercise with move() function that tracks position
- **Test Runner**: Executes scenarios through Jikiscript interpreter
- **Store Integration**: Proper data flow through TestSuiteManager to UI components
- **Visual Display**: Exercise view showing character position and movement

### UI Integration
- Test results display in TestResultsView
- Test buttons for switching between scenarios
- InspectedTestResultView shows exercise visualization
- Pass/fail status indicators
- Scrubber integration for frame navigation

### E2E Testing
- Comprehensive test suite in `tests/e2e/complex-exercise/test-runner.test.ts`
- Tests cover: running code, displaying results, handling failures, switching scenarios
- Added data-testid="run-button" for reliable test selection
- Follows best practices from testing guidelines

## ðŸ”§ Pending

### Immediate
- Fix interpreters package TypeScript errors to enable imports
- Once fixed, the test runner should work end-to-end

### Future Enhancements
- More complex exercises (MazeExercise, etc.)
- Proper expect DSL for cleaner assertions
- Task grouping (currently flattened to scenarios)
- Bonus test support
- Setup functions for exercise initialization
- Custom interpreter options per scenario

## How to Test (once interpreters are fixed)

1. Start dev server: `pnpm run dev`
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3060/dev/complex-exercise
3. Enter code in editor:
   ```javascript
   move()
   move()
   move()
   move()
   move()
   ```
4. Click "Run Code" button
5. Observe:
   - Two test scenarios pass (green badges)
   - Character position displays at 100px and 150px
   - Scrubber shows frames for navigation

## Running E2E Tests

```bash
# Install Chrome for Puppeteer (if not already done)
npx puppeteer browsers install chrome

# Run the test
pnpm test:e2e tests/e2e/complex-exercise/test-runner.test.ts
```

## Architecture Summary

```
runCode() â†’ runTests() â†’ Jikiscript.interpret() â†’ TestResults
                â†“
        TestSuiteManager.setCurrentTestFromResult()
                â†“
        Store updates currentTest with frames + display data
                â†“
        UI components render results + visualization
```

The system is fully integrated and ready to work once the interpreters package builds successfully.
