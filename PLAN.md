# Exercise System Restructuring Plan

## Completed ✅

### 1. Exercise System Restructured

- Created `components/exercises/` directory structure
- Basic movement exercise migrated to new structure
- Types defined for ExerciseDefinition, Task, and Scenario
- Exercise registry created with dynamic imports
- Removed `difficulty` and `tags` fields from exercise definition
- Renamed `id` to `slug` throughout exercise system

### 2. Orchestrator Simplified

- Constructor now public and takes only `ExerciseDefinition` parameter
- Removed static factory methods (`create` and `createForTesting`)
- Exercise initialization happens automatically in constructor
- Uses `exercise.slug` as the internal identifier for localStorage
- Removed need for separate `initializeExerciseData()` call

### 3. ComplexExercise Component Updated

- Loads exercise asynchronously before creating Orchestrator
- Simplified state management - uses orchestrator presence for loading state
- Clean error handling
- Uses `exerciseSlug` instead of `exerciseId`

### 4. Code Quality

- TypeScript compiles without errors for non-test files
- ESLint passes with no errors or warnings for non-test files

## Current Structure

### Directory Structure

```
components/exercises/
├── index.ts                 # Registry for all exercises
├── types.ts                 # Shared types
└── basic-movement/          # First exercise
    ├── index.ts            # Main export combining all parts
    ├── Exercise.ts         # Exercise class implementation
    ├── scenarios.ts        # Tasks and scenarios definitions
    └── metadata.json       # Exercise metadata
```

### Type Definitions (`exercises/types.ts`)

```typescript
export interface ExerciseDefinition {
  slug: string; // Changed from 'id'
  title: string;
  instructions: string;
  estimatedMinutes: number;
  initialCode: string;
  ExerciseClass: new () => Exercise;
  tasks: Task[];
  scenarios: Scenario[];
  hints?: string[];
  solution?: string;
}
```

### Usage Pattern

```typescript
// In ComplexExercise component
const loader = exercises[exerciseSlug];
const exercise = (await loader()).default;
const orchestrator = new Orchestrator(exercise);
```

## Completed ✅

### Test Updates Completed Successfully

#### Test Infrastructure Created:

1. **Created shared mock exercise** in `tests/mocks/`
   - `test-exercise/Exercise.ts` - TestExercise class
   - `test-exercise/scenarios.ts` - Test scenarios
   - `test-exercise/index.ts` - Exercise definition
   - `createTestExercise.ts` - Helper function

#### Files Updated:

All test files have been updated to use the new Orchestrator constructor pattern:

- ✅ `tests/test-utils/OrchestratorTestProvider.tsx`
- ✅ `tests/unit/components/complex-exercise/orchestrator/Orchestrator.test.ts`
- ✅ `tests/unit/components/complex-exercise/orchestrator/store-test-persistence.test.ts`
- ✅ `tests/unit/components/complex-exercise/ui/scrubber/InformationWidgetToggleButton.test.tsx`
- ✅ `tests/unit/components/complex-exercise/test-runner/runTests.test.ts`
- ✅ `tests/integration/complex-exercise/codemirror-simple.test.tsx`
- ✅ `tests/integration/complex-exercise/breakpoint-navigation.test.tsx`
- ✅ All 7 test pages in `app/test/`
- ✅ `components/complex-exercise/ui/codemirror/testing/TestingPage.tsx`

#### Verification:

- **TypeScript**: ✅ No errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` passes)
- **ESLint**: ✅ No errors (`pnpm run lint` passes)

## Benefits Achieved

- **Simpler API**: Single constructor parameter
- **Type Safe**: ExerciseDefinition ensures all required fields
- **Cleaner initialization**: Constructor handles everything
- **Clear Separation**: Exercise loading separate from orchestrator creation
- **Consistent naming**: Using 'slug' throughout for exercise identifier
- **Maintainable**: Each exercise self-contained in its directory
